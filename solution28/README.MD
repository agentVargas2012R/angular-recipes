Problem: You want to want to abstract out your index.html

Solution: Use Element Directives to abstract out your functionality

- Ceate an element directive using 'E' restrict type
- Use the 'templateUrl' to reference a path directive to the current location of the file
- Run this on a browser to avoid CORS issues
